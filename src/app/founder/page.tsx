                            Tarka Design Studio was built on a simple premise: strategy needs to live inside the code, not just on a presentation deck.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before starting the studio, I spent years seeing beautiful designs compromised in development, or excellent engineering let down by poor interfaces. The gap between thinking and building was where products died.

                        <p>
                            Tarka exists to close that gap. We don't just supply mockups or hand off vague directions. We engineer the experiences we design. This means understanding the medium deeply—knowing when to push the browser to its limits, and when restraint is the more sophisticated choice.
                        </p>
